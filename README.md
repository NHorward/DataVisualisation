# DataVisualisation
Nicole's assignments for the class Data Visualisation MCT3, 2018-2019. 

## Assignment 1: Nicole-O-Meter

### Process
I found some cool data on the amount of Nicole's per city on the website of the Belgian government. 

Data source: Voornamen van de totale bevolking per gemeente, STATBEL via: https://statbel.fgov.be/nl/open-data/voornamen-van-de-totale-bevolking-gemeente .


### Goal
Create a 3D map displaying interesting data about the amount of Nicole's and their location within Belgium. 

### Properties
Intent: A.1 Explanatory

Media: B Physical

Appearance: A.2 Static

Other: A.x 3D

### Results
It's looking good so far, but it's still a work in progress. I'll keep you posted!
