# DataVisualisation
Nicole's assignments for the class Data Visualisation MCT3, 2018-2019.

## Assignment 1: Nicole-O-Meter

### Process
I found some cool data on the amount of Nicole's per city on the website of the Belgian government.

Data source: Voornamen van de totale bevolking per gemeente, STATBEL via: https://statbel.fgov.be/nl/open-data/voornamen-van-de-totale-bevolking-gemeente .


### Goal
Create a 3D map displaying interesting data about the amount of Nicole's and their location within Belgium.

### Properties
Intent: A.1 Explanatory

Media: B Physical

Appearance: A.2 Static

Other: A.x 3D

### Results
It's looking good so far, but it's still a work in progress. I'll keep you posted!

## Assignment 2: Harold the Hamster

### Process
Last year, I created [an IoT device to track my hamsters runs in his hamster wheel](http://8bitsandabyte.com/project-floofball-an-iot-hamster-wheel/).

Over the course of a year, I collected quite a lot of interesting (semi reliable) data. It would be a waste not to analyse the data and make something nice.

### Goal
Create a heat map displaying when Harold ran the most / least per hour and per weekday.

### Properties
Intent: A.1 Explanatory

Appearance: A.2 Linear / Interactive

Other: A.x D3.js

### Results
A nice looking interactive heat map visualising Harold's running data, created with D3.js.

Please note that loading the CSV file doesn't work in Chrome and Internet Explorer, so the heat map doesn't show up.
However, it does work nicely in Firefox and Microsoft Edge.
